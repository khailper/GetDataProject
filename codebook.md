#Variables

##Subject
This is the ID number of the subject being measured.  All subjects were used, from both the training and test data.

##Activity
What was the subject doing when the measurement happened.  Was he or she walking on a level surface (WALKING), walking up an set of stairs(WALKING_UPSTAIRS), walking down a set of stairs(WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS), remaining seated (SITTING), standing still (STANDING), or laying down (LAYING)?

##Other variables
From the documentation of the source:
"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

For each measurement a mean and standard deviation are given.  These are averages of the means and standard deviations in the original dataset.  Averaging is done at the level of subject and activity 
(i.e. the average body acceleration for subject 1 while laying).
